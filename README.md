# FormalityRelations #

This package provides tools to study Kontsevich's universal formality morphism. In particular, the aim is to:

1. Generate all isomorphism classes of Kontsevich graphs contributing to the formality morphism (e=2n+m-2) or their relations (e=2n+m-3)
2. Canonically label (and orient) such graphs
3. Generate the Stokes relation of a graph with e=2n+m-3

These are used to produce the full set of formality relations, which are then solved for small orders. The end result is a complete table of the Kontsevich weights for small (n,m).
